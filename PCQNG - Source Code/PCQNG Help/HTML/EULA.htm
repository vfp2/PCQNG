      2. GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following rights:<br>
      2a. Licensed Copy. After you have purchased the license for this SOFTWARE 
      you are licensed to copy the SOFTWARE only into the memory of the number 
      of computers corresponding to the number of licenses purchased. Under no 
      other circumstances may the SOFTWARE be operated at the same time on more 
      than the number of computers for which you have paid a separate license 
      fee.<br>
      2b. Evaluation Copy. You may use the demonstration SOFTWARE from the day 
      that you install the SOFTWARE without charge on an evaluation basis until

      the SOFTWARE at the time of receipt. If you continue to use the SOFTWARE 
      after any date of expiry of the SOFTWARE without paying the license fee 
      you will be using the SOFTWARE on an unlicensed basis.<br>
      2c. Redistribution of Evaluation Copy. You may make copies of the

      its unmodified form via electronic means. You may not charge any fee for 
      the copy or use of the evaluation SOFTWARE itself, but you may charge a 
      distribution fee that is reasonably related to any cost you incur 
      distributing the evaluation SOFTWARE. You must not represent in any way 
      that you are selling the SOFTWARE itself. Your distribution of the 
      evaluation SOFTWARE will not entitle you to any compensation from The

      any copy of the SOFTWARE and anyone to whom you distribute the SOFTWARE is
