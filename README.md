# PCQNG

The PCQNG version for METrainer (formerly Psi Trainer) is optimized to be most responsive for MMI use. The basic engine is the same, but subsequent handling and processing is different. I included the license generator for do-it-yourself MMI development using the standard PCQNG software-enabled TRNG.
